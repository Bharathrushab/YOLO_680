# YOLO

The project involved the implementation of the object detection algorithm Yolo defined in the paper: [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf). YOLO poses the object detection problem as regression problem and uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.

- Dataset: 10,000 street scene images with pedestrians, cars, and traffic lights labels
- Implemented the whole pipeline from scratch and compared the performance of classifier in case of different targets for confidence loss
